# Tic-Tac-Toe

 In this project we created a Tic Tac Toe game using OOP. We used Ruby to write the game.
 
# What is Tic Tac Toe
 Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

 In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.

# How to play this game?
